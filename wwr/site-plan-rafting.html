    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>This website will allow white-whater sport lovers to easily explore the options of rafting down the snake river.
      They will be able to schedule a time to rent boats (and other necessary safety equipment), book a guide, and explore what path they want to take. 
      This website will build revenue by making the process of rafting a lot smoother. It will also promote some extra equipment
      that the company can rent out for extra charge, bringing in even more revenue.   
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>We are trying to extend the white-water rafting experience to all people who love the thrill of adventure. We target people of all levels of experience
      by providing the option of a guide and providing a map that grades different parts of the river from "Beginner" to "Advanced". We try to
      appeal mostly to groups and familys by offering discounts for equipment for groups over 8 people, seniors (over 65 years old), and any children under 12. We know that
      familys with young children will love the options of having a guide and also the safety courses that we offer. This site will make those options
      very easy to access. It is hard for a family to accurately and efficiently plan a safe rafting experince that everyone will love, but with this site,
      this process will be much easier.
